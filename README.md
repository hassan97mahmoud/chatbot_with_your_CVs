This project is a powerful and interactive CV (Resume) filtering assistant built with Streamlit, Google Gemini (via the Gemini 1.5 Flash model), and LangChain.

It enables HR professionals, recruiters, and hiring managers to upload multiple CVs in PDF format, process them into vector embeddings, and ask natural language questions to extract, summarize, compare, and rank candidates based on roles, skills, experience, and more.
